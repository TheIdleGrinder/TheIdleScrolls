    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The time has come to confront the treacherous lord who commands the cult threatening the realm. Within the walls of this castle you hope to find their secret headquarter. Here, you might be able to put an end to their insidious activities once and for all.</value>

    <value>You stand victorious in the corridors beneath the cultists' castle. While the leader himself has eluded you, destroying their final hideout should spell the end of the cult’s sinister activities.

But your optimism wanes as you realize that his escape wasn't a defeat but a strategic retreat: Several documents and maps identify an ancient lighthouse that sits atop a nearby cliff as the locus of a final ritual which will break down the walls between worlds. You need to pursue the remaining cultists and prevent their success at all costs!</value>

    <value>Beneath the castle, there is a giant labyrinthine dungeon. The cult's inner sanctum has to be in there.</value>

    <value>You confront the last of the cultists and their otherworldly allies, illuminated by the ghastly blue fire that burns atop the lighthouse. Suddenly, a surge of energy courses through the building, causing the azure flames to leap higher. There is a blinding flash, as the lighthouse's beams pierce the veil between worlds, burning the fabric of reality itself and creating a monstrous portal to the abyss beyond.</value>

  <data name="Story_Lighthouse2Open" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As you approach the lighthouse, you do not have to ask yourself if the ritual has already started: Each step on the rocky ground resonates with a discordant energy, and the very fabric of the world seems to ripple and warp around you. Shadows, thrown by the setting sun, appear twisted into grotesque shapes, and the air is pulsing with an otherworldly hum. You need to put an end to this, before the last boundaries between the worlds are dissolved.</value>

    <value>The beacon's blue beam seems to have attracted the attention of more than just ships. The cultists have somehow opened a gateway to a different world. Fortunately, disturbing their ritual caused the gate to collapse before too many of the demonic beasts could make it through.
You need to keep an eye out for further activities of these cultists!</value>

    <value>You have found the old beacon near which the cultists have made their camp. It is not exactly hard to spot, given that its beam is lit by a strange blue flame.</value>

    <value>The portal to the demonic realm stands wide open, a mesmerizing yet terrifying spectacle. A once-controllable situation has spiraled into an existential crisis, and now, a malevolent army spills forth. You cannot know how long this gateway will remain open or if it will ever close again. All you can do now, is to guard the threshold against the encroaching darkness and drive back whatever foe attempts to cross it.</value>
