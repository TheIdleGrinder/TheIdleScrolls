    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The time has come to confront the treacherous lord who commands the cult threatening the realm. Within the walls of this castle you hope to find their secret headquarter. Here, you might be able to put an end to their insidious activities once and for all.</value>

    <value>You stand victorious beneath the cultists' castle, but their leader has escaped—not in defeat, but in retreat: Documents reveal a final ritual at an ancient lighthouse, one that could shatter the walls between worlds. You need to pursue the remaining cultists and prevent their success at all costs!</value>

    <value>Beneath the castle, there is a giant labyrinthine dungeon. The cult's inner sanctum has to be in there.</value>

  <data name="Story_Lighthouse2Finished" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You confront the last of the cultists and their otherworldly allies, illuminated by the ghastly blue fire that burns atop the lighthouse. Suddenly, a surge of energy courses through the building, causing the azure flames to leap higher. There is a blinding flash, as the lighthouse's beams pierce the veil between worlds, burning the fabric of reality itself and creating a monstrous portal to the abyss beyond.</value>

  <data name="Story_Lighthouse2Open" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As you approach the lighthouse, you do not have to ask yourself if the ritual has already started: Each step on the rocky ground resonates with a discordant energy, and the very fabric of the world seems to ripple and warp around you. Shadows, thrown by the setting sun, appear twisted into grotesque shapes, and the air is pulsing with an otherworldly hum. You need to put an end to this, before the last boundaries between the worlds are dissolved.</value>

    <value>The beacon's blue beam seems to have attracted the attention of more than just ships. The cultists have somehow opened a gateway to a different world. Fortunately, disturbing their ritual caused the gate to collapse before too many of the demonic beasts could make it through.
You need to keep an eye out for further activities of these cultists!</value>

    <value>You have found the old beacon near which the cultists have made their camp. It is not exactly hard to spot, given that its beam is lit by a strange blue flame.</value>

    <value>There are rumours that a sinister cult of demon worshippers is operating in the area. You should look into that.</value>

    <value>After driving away its inhabitants, you search their hideout for clues to their further activities and make a huge discovery: It appears that the head of the cult is a powerful lord from a neighbouring region. You have to continue your journey to his castle and confront him.</value>

    <value>The portal to the demonic realm stands wide open, a mesmerizing yet terrifying spectacle. A once-controllable situation has spiraled into an existential crisis, and now, a malevolent army spills forth. You cannot know how long this gateway will remain open or if it will ever close again. All you can do now, is to guard the threshold against the encroaching darkness and drive back whatever foe attempts to cross it.</value>

    <value>The landscape around the lighthouse snaps into focus. You stagger as the world feels both immediate and distant, like waking from a dream. You remember fighting at the threshold, then just a moment of indescribable nothingness.
The sharp voices of those around you cut through the haze. The survivors stare, their astonishment giving way to joy. They rush toward you, some shouting your name. They say you vanished for mere seconds, yet the void clings faintly to your thoughts, a sensation without form.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Endgame_Void" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The portal’s connection is severed but the rupture in reality persists. What once served as a bridge to another place now stands adrift, its energy still surging but its destination lost.
Through the bluish glow, an unfamiliar realm comes into view. A web of twisting pathways stretches into the void, branching endlessly into a shadowed expanse. A landscape as intriguing as it is unsettling.
The void beckons to the bold and the reckless, a realm of mysteries that promise both great reward and untold peril.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Endgame_Pinnacle" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your expeditions into the Void have been many. Time and again, you’ve braved its twisting paths and shadowed expanses, pushing further with each foray.
Now, the twisting pathways converge and you find yourself in front of three portals, their flickering light unmistakably similar to the one you have been using to travel between this world and your own. These must be the remnants of other severed connections, doorways that survived the collapse.
Beyond them, your ultimate challenge awaits you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Endgame_Finished" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From humble beginnings, battling dummies and rats, to defending your world against an invasion, to walking between worlds yourself - you’ve come so far. Each challenge demanded not just strength but also your craftiness and dedication. You honed your skills, forged your path (and your gear), and became the hero these trials required.
For now, your story ends here. But who knows? In realms like these, endings often make way for new beginnings.</value>
